Summarize the project and what problem it was solving


A smart thermostat for houses is at the prototype stage. Before turning off, it will advance to a predetermined point. It also has two buttons, one on each side, that allow you to adjust the temperature set point.

What did you do particularly well?

Being able to loop the thermastate to be able to turn on and alert based off degrees.

Where could you improve?

Theres always room to improve, the biggest thing i could improve on is morse code for the project.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Didnt know how to work with embedded systems until now, I am still very shakey on it but the work from this class helped get my feet wet with it.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

State machines seem to be a good plot point on getting the ball rolling with code.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I added resources to everything i coded so that the next person could possibly relate to them incase any confusion on how i came to my conclusion arises.
